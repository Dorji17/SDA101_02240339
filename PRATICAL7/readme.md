HTML Structure:
The page consists of three main elements:
A div with the class text that contains the "SAMSUNG" text.
A div with the ID bot that contains a heading (WOW) styled with a background color.
A p tag with the "HELLO WORLD" text, styled with inline CSS for color.
Styling:
External CSS: The external CSS (STYLE.CSS) is linked but not yet fully utilized in this version. The internal styles in the <style> tag handle the basic design of the page.
Inline Styles: The inline style for the "HELLO WORLD" text sets its color to purple.

Add media queries in the STYLE.CSS file to ensure the page is responsive on all devices, particularly mobile.
Additional Styling:

Improve the visual design by incorporating animations, hover effects, or more complex layouts to make the page more dynamic.

Add JavaScript to make the page interactive, such as displaying dynamic content or handling user inputs.
