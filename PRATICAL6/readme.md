## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The layout adjusts automatically based on the screen size, with all items inside the flex container taking equal space.
- **Flexibility**: Flexbox allows for easy alignment and distribution of space among items in a container.
- **Basic Styling**: Each flex item has distinct background colors and spacing, making it easy to understand how Flexbox works.



Code Explanation
HTML Structure:
The HTML contains a div with a class of logo for the page header, and a div with a class of flex-container to hold the flex items.
Each flex-item within the flex-container represents a block of content that is styled using Flexbox.

CSS Styling:
The display: flex; property on .flex-container makes it a flex container.
The gap: 10px; property adds spacing between flex items.
The flex: 1; property ensures that all items inside the flex container are equally spaced.
Additional styles for background color, padding, and text alignment are included to enhance the layout's visual appearance.

Flexbox Layout:
Flexbox allows the container to adapt and distribute space evenly between its child items.
The example includes three items in the flex container, each taking equal space.
Future Enhancements
Responsive Design:

Further enhance the responsiveness by using media queries to adjust the layout on different screen sizes.
Interactivity:

Add JavaScript to dynamically modify the flex container or items, such as resizing or reordering flex items based on user input.
