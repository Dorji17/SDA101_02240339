HTML Structure:
The form consists of two main fields: a text input for the name and a select dropdown for choosing the room number.
The form data is submitted using the POST method to a server endpoint specified in the action attribute.

Validation:
The form uses the required attribute to ensure both fields must be filled before submission.
Future Improvements

Additional Fields:
You could add more fields such as a description of the maintenance issue, urgency level, or a contact number.


Server-Side Handling:
Set up a server-side script (in PHP, Node.js, Python, etc.) to process the submitted form data, store it in a database, and send confirmation emails.

Styling:
Add CSS to improve the appearance of the form, including layout adjustments for better readability and usability.

JavaScript Validation:
While HTML validation ensures fields are filled, adding JavaScript validation can allow for more detailed checks (e.g., validating room numbers or formatting of names).
