Features
Client-side Validation: Ensures that all required fields are filled and that password and confirm password match.
Error Messages: Displays error messages near each form field when validation fails.
Responsive Design: The form layout is responsive, ensuring it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
Technologies Used
HTML5: Markup for the form structure.
CSS: For styling the form and error messages (you can customize it to suit your design).
JavaScript: Handles the form validation and enables the submit button when the form is valid.
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/registration-form-validation.git
2. Navigate to the Project Folder
bash
Copy code
cd registration-form-validation
3. Open the index.html File
Open the index.html file in your browser to view the form:

bash
Copy code
open index.html
Alternatively, you can double-click on the index.html file to open it in your default browser.

4. Customization (Optional)
You can customize the styles by modifying the styles.css file. Feel free to change colors, fonts, and layout as desired.

5. JavaScript for Validation
The form’s validation logic is handled by the validation.js file. You can modify the validation rules or add more fields by updating this file. Make sure that the JavaScript file is linked correctly in your HTML.


How It Works
1. Form Fields
Username: Required field for the user's name.
Email: Required field for the user's email address. The email must follow a valid email format (e.g., user@example.com).
Password: Required field for setting the user's password.
Confirm Password: Required field to confirm the entered password. This field must match the password.
2. Validation
The submit button remains disabled until all fields are valid.
Error messages appear below the corresponding fields if the validation fails (e.g., invalid email format, password mismatch).
The JavaScript validation runs on form submission and individual input changes.
3. JavaScript Functionality
validation.js checks each field for validity and displays an error message for each invalid field.
The script checks if the password and confirm password match, ensures the email is valid, and all fields are required.
